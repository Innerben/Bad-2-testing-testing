-sometimes SocializeState.onEnter "locations" local variable is None

-scheduled events (time-based) could be a data struct that is referenced by each actor containing fields such as:
    -trigger time
    -location to enter
each update(), every actors scheduled event reference will be checked and an event triggered if the current game time matches the event's trigger time

-actor -> constrain field stating which location(s) the actor may visit

-Job, Date, etc. components provide event data to an actor's schedule component
